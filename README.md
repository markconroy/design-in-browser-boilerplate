Design in Browser Boilerplate

This is an attempt to put together a sensible (and quick) boilerplate for
creating designs in the browser.

It aims to use Drupal classes where possible to allow CSS be transferred
directly from this to a Drupal theme with minimal effort.

It uses Zen-Grids for laying out of items. For this reason, it's best to use
this boilerplate with Zen themes, though it should work for any theme.
